## Exercise 00 : Graphical Phonebook
> To design a phonebook Qt application, you will need to use the Qt framework and its various classes and libraries. Here is a general outline of how to design a phonebook Qt application:

1. Create a Qt project: First, create a new Qt project using Qt Creator. You can choose a console application or a GUI application, depending on the level of functionality you want to add to the phonebook.

2. Create a contact class: Create a C++ class that represents a contact in the phonebook. This class should have member variables for the contact's name, phone number, email address, and any other relevant information. You should also provide member functions to access and modify these variables.

3. Create a contact list class: Create a C++ class that represents a list of contacts in the phonebook. This class should have member variables for a list of contacts and member functions to add, remove, and search for contacts in the list.

4. Create a user interface: Use the Qt Designer tool to create a user interface for the phonebook application. This interface should allow the user to add, remove, and search for contacts in the phonebook. You can use widgets like buttons, text fields, and list views to implement this interface.

5. Connect the interface to the contact list: Use Qt's signals and slots mechanism to connect the user interface to the contact list. For example, you can create a slot that gets called when the user clicks the "Add Contact" button, which adds a new contact to the contact list.

6. Save and load the contact list: Implement functionality to save the contact list to a file and load it back into the application. You can use Qt's file I/O classes to accomplish this.

7. Implement search functionality: Add functionality to search for contacts in the phonebook based on name, phone number, or other criteria. You can use Qt's built-in search classes or implement your own search algorithms.

8. Add additional functionality: Finally, add any additional functionality you want to the phonebook application. For example, you can add the ability to edit existing contacts, import contacts from other sources, or display the contact list in different formats.

Overall, designing a phonebook Qt application involves creating C++ classes to represent contacts and a contact list, connecting the user interface to these classes, and adding additional functionality as needed. By following these steps, you can create a functional and user-friendly phonebook application using the Qt framework.
